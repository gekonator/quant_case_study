# Crypto post-pump mean-reversion backtest

A held-out historical backtest of the thesis that **altcoin pumps detected on
Upbit tend to mean-revert**, and may be shortable after the initial move.

The project is deliberately structured as a *falsification exercise*, not a
performance showcase: each claim is a testable hypothesis with a stated null,
a calibration / held-out split, and a pass/fail criterion fixed **before** the
held-out data is evaluated. The dated Git history preserves that sequence.

---

## Research thesis

A sharp, Korea-driven upward move in an altcoin on Upbit is, on average,
**partially reverted** over the following hours or days — enough that a short
opened *after* the move and held to a fixed horizon has **positive net
expectancy after costs**.

The edge is expected to have a characteristic shape: a **high win rate with
negative skew** — many small wins (reversion) against rarer large losses (the
pump continues). Positive expectancy is therefore necessary but not sufficient;
the thesis must also survive the left tail, which is why confidence intervals,
not point estimates, drive every decision.

---

## Hypotheses

The two hypotheses are nested in importance: **H2 is only meaningful once H1
holds.** H1 asks *whether* qualifying pumps revert profitably; H2 asks *whether
the Korean premium is what makes them do so*, rather than generic mean
reversion.

### H1 — Reversion exists, net of costs

Shorting a qualifying pump (see *Signals*) yields **positive net-of-costs
expectancy** on data not used to calibrate the filter thresholds.

- **H0:** expectancy ≤ 0.
- **Test:** temporal held-out split. Thresholds and trade geometry are selected
  only on the 2026 calibration sample; expectancy — with a bootstrap confidence
  interval — is measured once on the untouched 2025 historical holdout.
- **Pass criterion (pre-specified):** held-out bootstrap CI lower bound > 0
  **and** held-out expectancy ≥ 50 % of calibration expectancy.

### H2 — The edge is Korea-specific

Among candidates that pass H1's filters, expectancy is **conditional on the
kimchi-premium state** in a pre-specified direction — higher when the premium
behaves as the mechanism predicts than when it is flat or blind to it.

- **H0:** expectancy(kimchi-conditioned) = expectancy(kimchi-blind) — i.e. the
  premium carries no information.
- **Test:** a **paired contrast**. All other parameters are held fixed at their
  H1-calibrated values; only the kimchi filter is toggled on/off on the *same*
  candidate pool, so the comparison isolates the premium from confounding
  parameter combinations.
- **Constraint:** the kimchi range itself is fixed on the calibration sample and
  evaluated on the holdout — never grid-searched and reported on the same
  sample. Folding kimchi into the
  main grid would *not* test H2: the optimizer could silently discard it, and we
  would learn nothing about attribution.

> If H1 holds but H2 fails, the strategy may still be tradeable — but the
> "Korean" story is decorative, and it is really just generic post-pump
> reversion.

## Mechanism

Why the overshoot forms and why it collapses are **two independent processes** —
this asymmetry is what the trade exploits.

- **Formation.** Korea's capital controls impede cross-border arbitrage. A local
  retail surge can push the Upbit price above the global price, and arbitrageurs
  cannot immediately flatten the gap.
- **Collapse.** The reversion is *not* driven by arbitrage arriving late. It is
  driven by exhaustion of the transient retail buying pressure that caused the
  spike. The overshoot fades on its own.

This is why the entry timing is **fixed to the Korean session**, not
grid-searched: the mechanism predicts a specific window, so optimizing the
hour freely would both risk overfitting to a spurious time and weaken the
mechanistic claim.

---

## Signals & parameters

**Event filters (what flags a Korean pump on an Upbit hourly candle):**

- **Volume** — event-hour traded value exceeds the cumulative value of the
  preceding hours (scored as `volume_points`).
- **Breakout** — event-hour high exceeds prior hours' highs by a margin (scored
  as `growth_points`).
- **Pump magnitude** — intra-hour move (open → high) above a base percentage
  (scored as `pump_points`).

**Trade geometry (calibrated on IS):** stop-loss %, take-profit capture
(fraction of the run-up from reference to entry).

**Fixed by mechanism (not grid-searched):** entry window (Korean session),
exit horizon.

**Kimchi premium** — `KRW / (USDT × KRW-USDT) − 1`, computed on-the-fly from
1-minute data and sampled as a pre-event baseline, at entry, at exit, and as a
timeline. Reserved exclusively for the H2 paired contrast.

---

## Validation protocol

- **Data:** frozen 1-minute Parquet datasets (Binance USDT-M perps + funding,
  Upbit KRW markets, Upbit KRW-USDT), fetched once. No live API calls during
  backtesting.
- **Calibration / holdout:** calibration = 2026-01-01 → 2026-06-01;
  historical holdout = 2025-01-01 → 2026-01-01. The holdout predates the
  calibration period, so this is not forward validation; it remained untouched
  until a single final evaluation per configuration.
- **No hardcoded parameters:** filter thresholds and trade geometry are
  grid-searched on IS only.
- **Point-in-time execution:** fills on the next bar; no look-ahead. Universe
  includes tokens that later delisted (survivorship-aware).
- **Minimum trade gate:** a config is eligible only above a minimum IS trade
  count, to prevent thin-sample overfitting.
- **Selection metric:** bootstrap CI *lower bound* on expectancy — not the point
  estimate.
- **Plateau requirement:** the selected config must sit on a stable plateau in
  the grid (neighbours by ±1 grid step do not collapse), not an isolated peak.
- **Position-cap handling:** a maximum-concurrent-positions cap is deliberately
  **excluded** from the grid. A cap selects trades by their order within a day,
  not by signal quality, which biases the sample and confounds the edge test. A
  shuffle test (re-ordering same-day trades) showed that cap-dependent results
  were sensitive to historical sequence rather than signal quality. A cap
  belongs to risk management, applied afterward — not to the hypothesis test.

**Cost model:** taker fee 0.04 %/side, real funding over the holding period
(`(entry, exit]`, scaled by mark price), slippage 0.05 % on entry and forced
time-exit. Same-bar stop+take tie resolves to the stop (conservative).

## Results

### H1 — tested on two independent configurations

H1 was evaluated on **two entry regimes** derived from the same thesis. The
result is reported per-configuration, because they behaved differently — and the
divergence is itself the point.

#### Daily short — **PASS**

Entry at the Korean session open, held to the next day's session close.
Selected config: `volume_points ≥ 40, growth_points ≥ 15, pump_points ≥ 5,
SL 13 %, TP 90 %-capture`.

| Metric | Calibration (2026) | Historical holdout (2025) |
|---|---|---|
| Trades | 181 | 171 |
| Expectancy / trade | +26.79 USDT (+2.68 %) | +16.42 USDT (+1.64 %) |
| Bootstrap CI (95 %) lower | +15.63 | **+5.20** |
| Win rate | 76.8 % | 71.9 % |
| Profit factor | 2.36 | 1.72 |
| Max drawdown (realized) | 3.0 % | 5.6 % |

Both pre-specified criteria were met in the historical holdout: CI lower bound
+5.20 > 0, and held-out expectancy (+16.42) exceeded 50 % of calibration
expectancy (+13.39 threshold). Expectancy was 39 % lower than in calibration but
remained positive with a confidence interval above zero.

#### Night short — **FAIL**

Entry in a short post-midnight-UTC window, closed same session. Selected config:
`volume_points ≥ 5, growth_points ≥ 3, SL 8 %, TP 90 %-capture`.

| Metric | Calibration (2026) | Historical holdout (2025) |
|---|---|---|
| Trades | 704 | 992 |
| Expectancy / trade | +3.47 USDT (+0.35 %) | +2.19 USDT |
| Bootstrap CI (95 %) lower | +0.58 | **−0.27** |

The night signal was flagged as weak in calibration — no configuration in the top
20 formed a plateau (every neighbour dropped the CI lower bound below zero). On
the holdout, expectancy stayed mildly positive but the bootstrap CI **crossed zero**:
the edge is statistically indistinguishable from noise. Per protocol, this
configuration is archived, not carried forward.

### Interpretation

The split outcome is consistent with the protocol discriminating between a
stronger and a weaker candidate. The night signal never formed a plateau in
calibration and remained statistically indistinguishable from zero in the
holdout, so it was discarded rather than promoted as a tradable result.

**Honest caveats on the daily PASS:**

- Held-out CAGR (~40 %) is far below calibration CAGR (~318 %). This is not only expectancy
  decay: 2026 was unusually rich in qualifying events (181 trades in 5 months vs
  171 in 12 months). **Signal density is non-stationary.**
- `volume_points ≥ 40` sits at the **edge of the grid** — the true optimum may
  lie beyond it and was not probed. This is a candidate for a follow-up IS grid
  extension, not something the current holdout validated.

**Status: H1 supported on the historical holdout for the daily configuration;
not supported for the night configuration.** H2 was then tested on the daily
configuration (below).

### H2 — Korea-specificity — **NOT SUPPORTED**

With the daily H1 configuration frozen, the kimchi premium was tested for
attribution. The Δkimchi band was calibrated on IS **by the shape** of the
expectancy–vs–premium relationship (where expectancy crosses zero), not by
maximizing PnL, and then frozen for a single held-out paired contrast.

**IS shape (2026)** — expectancy by Δkimchi bin, bins fixed before inspecting
PnL:

| Δkimchi (p.p.) | N | Expectancy | Bootstrap CI |
|---|---|---|---|
| < 0 | 27 | +23.7 | [+1.9, +49.5] |
| [0, 0.5) | 54 | +12.6 | [−6.5, +30.1] |
| [0.5, 1) | 37 | +28.3 | [+8.7, +48.3] |
| [1, 1.5) | 21 | +49.2 | [+26.9, +69.4] |
| [1.5, 2) | 9 | +75.2 | [+46.7, +107.6] |
| [2, 2.5) | 8 | +37.2 | [−52.6, +125.3] |
| [2.5, 3) | 7 | −0.8 | [−84.4, +81.4] |
| ≥ 3 | 18 | +26.5 | [−34.7, +91.0] |

The mechanistic prediction (inverted profile — moderate premium good, extreme
premium bad) is only *partially* visible: expectancy peaks at [1.5, 2) and win
rate degrades above 2 p.p. But two facts argue against a Korea-specific story:
the **Δkimchi < 0 bin is solidly positive** (trades profit even when the premium
*fell* into entry), and the extreme tail (≥ 3) stays positive. The shape-derived
band came out as `(−∞, 2.5)` — it only excludes the single failing bin.

**Historical holdout paired contrast (2025), one run:**

| | Blind | Conditioned |
|---|---|---|
| N | 171 | 156 (band removed 15) |
| Expectancy | +16.42 | +17.93 |
| CI | [+4.8, +27.0] | [+7.0, +29.4] |
| Win rate / PF | 71.9 % / 1.72 | 74.4 % / 1.81 |

Difference (conditioned − blind): **+1.51 USDT/trade, paired 95 % CI
[−2.19, +5.07].** The pre-specified criterion required the CI lower bound > 0 — it
is not. **H0 not rejected.**

**Interpretation.** The kimchi gate produces no statistically distinguishable
improvement. Combined with the positive Δkimchi < 0 bin on IS, the evidence
points to the edge being **generic post-pump mean reversion** — reversion driven
by the Upbit pump event itself (detected via volume/breakout/magnitude on Upbit
activity), *not* by the cross-exchange price premium. Binance is the execution
venue for the short; the predictive signal lives entirely on the Upbit side.

Two caveats, so the conclusion is not overstated:

- The shape-derived band was weakly discriminating (removed only 15/171 trades),
  so the two branches overlap heavily and the contrast had little room to
  separate. This follows from the honest "by shape" rule, not a protocol defect.
- *Reference only, not pre-specified, and not used for the verdict:* the original
  author's band [0.2, 1.7) gives diff +10.96, CI [−1.11, +23.37] on N = 71 — a
  signal on the edge of significance. A moderate-premium zone *may* carry
  information, but it could not be proven on this data volume. Registered as a
  hypothesis for a future fresh period (e.g. IS 2026-H2), **not** re-tested on
  this sample.

## Post-validation diagnostics

Beyond the hypothesis tests, the frozen daily configuration was profiled on a
fixed 10,000 USDT base: Monte Carlo (10,000 bootstrap paths of the held-out trades)
and a slippage stress over a 5×5×7 grid stressing entry, time-exit and stop
fills separately. Expectancy remains positive across the realistic slippage zone for
post-pump alts (entry/exit 0.1–0.2 %, stop 0.3–0.75 %); the only failing grid
point is all three components at their extremes simultaneously. Full numbers,
equity curves and distribution charts: **[REPORT.md](REPORT.md)**.

## Reproducibility

- Environment: Python ≥ 3.12, `pip install -r requirements.txt`
  (duckdb, pandas, numpy, matplotlib, requests).
- **Single source of truth:** the frozen strategy (signal formulas, trade
  simulator, data loaders) lives in `engine.py`; every research script imports
  it rather than redefining the logic. A parity reference with every
  intermediate detector value per signal (`make_parity_reference.py` →
  `results/detector_parity_reference.csv`) asserts that the engine reproduces
  the published trade counts and PnL exactly.
- Data pipeline (fetch once, freeze): `fetch_universe.py` →
  `fetch_datasets.py` → `convert_to_parquet.py`. Raw and Parquet data are not
  distributed (≈15 GB); the scripts rebuild them from public exchange APIs.
- Grid search & metrics: `stage_b_grid.py` → `results/grid_day.csv`,
  `results/grid_night.csv`, `results/top20_*.csv`
- Frozen chosen configs & their trades: `results/chosen_trades_*.csv`
- OOS run: `stage_oos.py` → `results/oos_trades_*.csv`
- Engine verification against reference (1:1 price/exit match on shared
  trades): `stage_a_verify.py` (an earlier diff harness is kept in
  `archive/legacy_dayshort_diff.py`), `results/legacy_diff_matched.csv`.
  The reference trade log itself
  (`data/reference/trades.csv`) is a third party's trading record and is
  **not distributed** with the repository.
- H2 kimchi contrast: `stage_h2.py`, `results/h2_kimchi_bins_is.csv`,
  `results/h2_paired_oos.csv`
- Diagnostics: `metrics_fixed_base.py`, `monte_carlo.py`,
  `slippage_stress.py`, `make_charts.py`; exploratory decomposition —
  `exploratory_baseline.py`
- Bootstrap seeds are fixed throughout; committed CSVs reproduce bit-for-bit.
- `archive/` holds superseded early-phase scripts kept for provenance.

## Limitations

Known weaknesses, stated up front rather than discovered by a reviewer:

- **Historical holdout precedes calibration.** Calibration = 2026 (recent),
  holdout = 2025 (earlier). This is a valid held-out historical test, but it is
  not a walk-forward test: forward
  degradation from the calibration regime is untested. Chosen deliberately to
  calibrate on the regime closest to live deployment; a true forward test
  begins with 2026-H2 data.
- **No formal multiple-testing correction.** 1,600 grid configurations are
  mitigated by CI-lower-bound selection, a plateau requirement and a single
  pre-specified held-out evaluation — but no White's Reality Check /
  deflated-Sharpe style correction was applied.
- **Bootstrap assumes i.i.d. trades.** Up to 7 positions overlap in time and
  signals cluster by day, so the confidence intervals are somewhat
  optimistic. A day-cluster bootstrap was used only in the exploratory
  decomposition.
- **Realized-only equity.** Floating drawdown of open positions is invisible
  in MDD; with SL 13 % and up to ~7 concurrent positions the true
  mark-to-market drawdown can transiently exceed the reported figures
  (margin call is unreachable at ≤ 0.7x leverage).
- **Capacity is not modeled.** Flat 1,000 USDT sizing; the slippage stress
  only roughly approximates larger sizes on illiquid post-pump books.
- **2025 was reused** after the H1 held-out evaluation for diagnostics (Monte Carlo,
  slippage stress, exploratory decomposition). Diagnostics do not change the
  verdicts, but any *configuration* change now requires a fresh forward sample.
- **`volume_points ≥ 40` sits on the grid edge**; the region beyond was never
  probed.

## Summary of findings

| Hypothesis | Claim | Verdict |
|---|---|---|
| **H1** (daily) | Qualifying Upbit pumps revert profitably, net of costs | **Supported on the historical holdout** — expectancy +16.42, CI [+5.20, +27.77] |
| **H1** (night) | Same, for the post-midnight regime | **Not supported** — held-out CI crosses zero |
| **H2** | The edge is Korea-specific (kimchi premium carries information) | **Not supported** — kimchi gate gives no distinguishable improvement |

The daily configuration retained positive net expectancy in the historical
holdout, while the "Korean premium" explanation was not supported. The evidence
is more consistent with generic post-pump mean reversion signalled by Upbit
activity, with Binance as the execution venue. Forward validation on data
collected after calibration is still required.
